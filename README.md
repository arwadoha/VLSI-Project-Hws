# Low-Cost Enhanced Folded Pipeline Multiplier Design and Implementation for IoT Devices, Birzeit University, 2024.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a low-cost, high-performance multiplier for **Internet of Things (IoT)** devices. The key innovation is the use of a **folded pipeline architecture** that minimizes the critical route length, improving both speed and power efficiency. The design is optimized for **VLSI** applications, utilizing a generic 32nm or smaller **CMOS** library for cost-effective implementation.

## Objectives

- Develop a high-performance multiplier using a folded pipeline architecture.
- Optimize the design for cost-effective implementation in IoT devices.
- Reduce implementation costs while improving performance compared to conventional methods.
- Integrate the design with high-level synthesis (HLS) tools to explore design-space trade-offs using **COSMOS** for efficient hardware accelerator development.
